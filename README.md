## Rinha de Compiler

This is my implementatio of an interpreter for the [rinha de compilers](https://github.com/aripiprazole/rinha-de-compiler) competition.

Although the challenge's name includes 'compilers', the organizers made their own [compiler to AST](https://docs.rs/rinha/latest/rinha/) just for the competition. That is why I call my solution an interpreter.

It's my first time with an interpreter and I am new to Rust, so take everything here with a piece of salt.
